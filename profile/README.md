**SinfonIA** is a social robotics research group at Universidad de los Andes. Our mission is to bridge the gap between cutting-edge laboratory research and real-world applications by transforming advanced robotics into engaging experiences for the public and industry alike.

Our work spans from developing interactive solutions with the Pepper robot to participating in international competitions like RoboCup. Through public events and corporate collaborations, we showcase how social robotics can enhance human interaction and drive innovative technological solutions.
